# data-butler
Small repo to start collecting my various data collection and manipulation scripts.

Everything in here should be pretty straightforward, nothing you couldn't do with other tools, but specific to some of my use cases. For example, in writing a lot of test config files for API performance testing with JMeter, I found it useful to have a script that will take a single column CSV and transform it into a multicolumn, multirow CSV to facilitate building JSON payloads of various sizes.

I will be adding in my other scripts as I have time to revisit them and can insure there are no IP claims from any previous employers.

dat_belt (as in Bat Belt) will become an overall launch point for other scripts. I intend to strip any data functionality from it, modularizing components as I'm able to add them in.
